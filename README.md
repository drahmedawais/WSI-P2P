This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:  
**"Comparative Study of MIL Aggregators for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification"**  
*[Authors]*, *[Conference/Journal]*, *[Year]*  

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Comparative analysis** of MIL aggregators (Mean/Max/LSE/Attention/K-Top) on histopathology data
- **Novel K-Top pooling** for sparse tumor detection
- **Reproducible benchmarks** on TCGA & in-house datasets
- **Attention visualization** tools for interpretability
